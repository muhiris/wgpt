## Usage
To get started with the CLI tool, you'll be asked to provide a cookie from `https://bard.google.com/`. First, log in to the website and copy the `value` of the `__Secure-1PSID` cookie, which you'll then use as your initial input. After this setup, the tool will operate normally, and you can interact with it directly from your terminal. Below are some usage examples:

```bash
wgpt Hello, AI!
```
